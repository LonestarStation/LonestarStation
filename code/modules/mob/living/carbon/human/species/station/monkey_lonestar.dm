	name = "Solar Fauna - Common Lonestar Raccoon"
	desc = {"Classification: procyon solustellar
<br><br>
The common Lonestar raccoon, a descendant of the Earth based species, is a small omnivorous pack rodent that was first sighted on the Comanche asteroid in 2157. Since their discovery they have been found to function comfortably in small groups, typically hiding and scavenging in uninhabited areas. The Lonestar raccoon exhibits above average intelligence, having been seen displaying a clear understanding of complex tool use. Additionally, they are larger and thicker than their Earth based cousins. They are currently thriving in countless social groups in the disused maintenance tunnels of their asteroid home.
<br><br>
The Lonestar raccoon can behave in wildly unpredictable ways when cornered, some have even been seen to employ the use of objects as weapons to fend off would be attackers. While they share the omnivorous metabolism of their cousins, they have developed apart from them in a phoron rich environment. This has caused a variety of mutations in the species.
<br><br>
They are generally considered a type of pest to the citizens of Lonestar, their disposition being generally skittish around the human residents. Some communities on Lonestar insist that they are harmless and make lasting friendships.
<br><br>
Limited studies suggest analytical abilities beyond standard examples of Earth born raccoons, but their ability to escape from or sabotage most holding cells makes laboratory testing inadvisable at best."}
